# Change Log

## [0.2.0]

- Mainly the background color of **selections in inputs (besides the editor)** (`selection.background`) is changed.  
  For the absense of `selection.foreground` in VSCode theme color basic properties, it is strongly recommended set `".input::selection": "color: #333"` to your `customizeUI.stylesheet` setting that required [Customize UI](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=iocave.customize-ui) and [Monkey Patch](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=iocave.monkey-patch) extensions to be installed.
- The **match highlight background colors of peek view** is also modified.

## [0.1.0]

- Base on the classical Monokai theme, I revise the color of comments from gray-yellow to green.
